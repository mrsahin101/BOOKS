# NOTES

- Before using any variables, always remember initializing them.

- **sizeof** keyword returns size of given variable.How many bytes of that variable it returned.

## POINTERS

- & operator is used for getting adrres of variable. **%p** is pointer placeholder.

- Pointer variable holds memory address. Syntax : type* pointer_variable;

- Pointers work in chunks the same size as their variable type.

- When we doing pointer arithmetic what compiler sees :  pointer + (addition count * sizeof(variable type))

- Pointer variables must be assigned an address before they can be used. They must be initialized.

- *pointer notation we can dereference the pointer.

## Binary And Operations
- Nibble is half-byte. (4-bit).

- Shift right syntax : result = value >> steps;

- With Shifting to right or left 0 feeded from otherside, but with rotation shifted bit goes back to otherside of number.
