# NOTES

- Before using any variables, always remember initializing them.

- **sizeof** keyword returns size of given variable.How many bytes of that variable it returned.

## POINTERS

- & operator is used for getting adrres of variable. **%p** is pointer placeholder.

- Pointer variable holds memory address. Syntax : type* pointer_variable;

- Pointers work in chunks the same size as their variable type.

- When we doing pointer arithmetic what compiler sees :  pointer + (addition count * sizeof(variable type))
