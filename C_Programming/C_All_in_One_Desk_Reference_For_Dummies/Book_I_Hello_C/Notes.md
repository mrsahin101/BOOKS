# NOTES

- History of computation goes to Charles Babbage and his analytical engine.(1822)

- Then U.S goverment used concept from analytical engine and created for modern computer ENIAC!

- Then John Von Neuman developed subroutines and make repeating loops, if then structure. Which lead to Short code binary programming language.

- This lead to first major programming language FORTRAN. 

- Then this lead to COBOL -> first programming language turlly English-like!

- Same time COBOL developed, Algol was developed. This programming language introduced many programming techniques still being used today!

- Then Pascal was developed in order to use structured programming.

- Meanwhile over at AT&T Bell Labs in 1972 Dennis Ritchie was working on two languages : B(for Bell) and BCPL(Basic Combined Programming Language)

- Inspired by Pascal, Mr.Ritchie developed the C Programming language.

- In 1983, C programmer Bjarne Stoustroup developed object-oriented programming(OOP) extensions to the C language and created C++ programming language.

- C++ is %95 original C.

- All C language programs must have a **main()** function!


### C language Source code syntax
-   #include <something.h>
    int main()
    {
        statement;
        statement;
        return(0);
    }
