# NOTES

- Computers are all about I/O. There is always some sort of input or about devices involved.

- The keyboard is standart input device, nicknamed **stdin**.

- The screen is standart output device, nicknamed **stdout**.

- Third standart IO device is **stderr**, reserved for error output.

- Basically everything in computer is file. A file is collection of stuff or data.

- Because everything is file, we can open **stdin** and read input or we can out **stdout** and save text to it and it will appear on screen. 

- EOF character defined in stdio file for windows is ctrl + z

- Input redirection is done by **<** in Windows and Linux.

- output redirection is done by **>** in Windows and Linux. Also we can perform append with **>>**.

- To display file content from prompt, It can be used as **cat file.extension**. Also we can use **cat file.extension | more** to display file content in chunks.
