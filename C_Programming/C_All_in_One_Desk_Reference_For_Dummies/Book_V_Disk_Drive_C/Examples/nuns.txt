There were these two nuns walking in the park. One of the
nuns said to the other one, “I believe I have a pebble in
my shoe.” So they stopped and sat on a park bench, while
the one nun removed her shoe, plucked out the pebble, and
then put her shoe back on. The nuns then got up and
continued walking through the park and enjoying the day.
