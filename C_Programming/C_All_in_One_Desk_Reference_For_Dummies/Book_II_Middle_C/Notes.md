# NOTES

- When using declaring **unsigned long int** order or predence doesnt matter. We can also do this **long unsigned int** : Both are same for the compiler

- Type-Casting syntax : (type) variable;

- If we want to divide 2 integer and get result as floating point, Atleast one of integer has to be casted as floating point number!
