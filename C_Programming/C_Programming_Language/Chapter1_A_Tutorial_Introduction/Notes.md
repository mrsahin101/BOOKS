# A Tutorial Introduction
- C language is general purpose language.
- Closely associated with Unix.
- C language is relatively **low level** language.
- In this revision of C(ANSI C), multi-programming not supported, only **single-thread** control flow is supported.
- c language retains this basic philosophy, **programmers know what they are doing, it only requires that they state their intentions explicitly**

- **Symbolic Constants**
``` C
#define name replacement_text
```
- In C all functions arguments are passed **by value**. But doesn't work for arrays. Arrays are passed by reference.
