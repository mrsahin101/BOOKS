# OPTIONAL FEATURES
- C++ is feature rich language.

## Chapter 23 -> A New Assignment Operator, Should you Decide to Accept It
- C++ enables the programmer to define the operators for classes that the programmer has created in addition to these intrinsic operators. This called **operator overloading**.
- The programmer cannot overload the ., ::, *(derefrence) and & operators
- The programmer cannot invent new operators. You cannot invent the x $ y.
- The format of the operators cannot be changed. Thus, you cannot define an operation %i because % is binary operator
- The operator precedence cannot change. A program cannot force operator+ to be evaluated before operator*.
- The operators cannot be redefined when applied to intrinsic types
